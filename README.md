# Clinical-Decision-Support-System
The CDSS for Opioid Use Disorder project developed a clinical decision support system prototype designed to aid clinicians in early diagnosis and personalized management of opioid use disorder (OUD). The project was executed by a multidisciplinary team within the Department of Health Informatics at IUPUI under expert guidance. It focused on leveraging evidence-based clinical decision rules, derived from recent literature and practice-based experience, to create a knowledge-based system that uses IF-THEN logic. Implemented within the OpenEMR platform, the system integrates patient demographics, medical history, laboratory tests, and other clinical indicators to identify individuals at high risk for OUD, particularly among young adults aged 18-25.

The prototype is divided into two main components: one addressing pre-clinical manifestations and diagnostic criteria, and the other outlining treatment strategies through both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Key features include the use of ICD-10 mappings and the creation of tailored clinical decision rules for interventions such as methadone dosage adjustments and alternative therapies for side effects. Cohorts were generated using OHDSI ATLAS to validate and refine the system. Overall, the project demonstrates a comprehensive, patient-centered approach that enhances clinical decision-making, reduces alert fatigue, and aims to improve patient outcomes while mitigating the societal burden of opioid addiction.
